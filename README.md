# 3DTumorSegmentationComputerVision
Person Project in which I try and design a 3D U-Net model that is used to train on 3D MRI Scans of Brain and is used to predict the presence of a Tumor. This project is an extension of my previous project in which I did the exact same thing but on 2D segments and this is an extension of that project in 3D
